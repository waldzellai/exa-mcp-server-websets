**Welcome to Exa's Content Collections!**

Content collections help you gather, organize, and enhance web content at scale. Here's how to get started:

**Step 1: Create Your First Collection**
Use the websets_manager tool with operation "create_collection":
\`\`\`
operation: "create_collection"
collection: {
  searchQuery: "AI startups in San Francisco 2024",
  description: "Research on AI companies in SF",
  advanced: {
    resultCount: 20,
    focusArea: "company"
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Step 2: Monitor Progress**
Check status with operation "get_collection_status":
\`\`\`
operation: "get_collection_status"
resourceId: "your-collection-id"
\`\`\`

**Step 3: Explore Your Content**
Once complete, view items with operation "list_content_items":
\`\`\`
operation: "list_content_items"
resourceId: "your-collection-id"
\`\`\`

**Next Steps:**
- Search within your collection
- Enhance content with AI analysis
- Set up notifications for updates
        `
      },

      creating_collections: {
        title: "Creating Effective Content Collections",
        content: `
**Creating Content Collections**

Collections take 10-15 minutes to build but provide rich, organized content.

**Basic Collection:**
\`\`\`
operation: "create_collection"
collection: {
  searchQuery: "sustainable fashion brands",
  description: "Research on eco-friendly clothing companies"
}
\`\`\`

**Advanced Collection with Filters:**
\`\`\`
operation: "create_collection"
collection: {
  searchQuery: "fintech companies Series A funding",
  description: "Fintech startups that raised Series A in 2024",
  advanced: {
    resultCount: 50,
    focusArea: "company",
    criteria: [
      { description: "Must have raised Series A funding" },
      { description: "Founded after 2020" }
    ],
    tags: {
      "industry": "fintech",
      "funding_stage": "series_a"
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Tips for Better Collections:**
- Be specific in your search query
- Use criteria to filter results
- Set appropriate result counts (10-100)
- Add descriptive tags for organization
        `
      },

      troubleshooting: {
        title: "Troubleshooting Common Issues",
        content: `
**Common Issues and Solutions**

**Collection Creation Issues:**
- ‚ùå "Collection failed": Try more specific search queries
- ‚ùå "No results found": Broaden your search terms
- ‚ùå "Timeout": Collections with 100+ results may take longer

**Search Issues:**
- ‚ùå "Search returned no results": Try broader query terms
- ‚ùå "Search taking too long": Reduce maxResults parameter

**Enhancement Issues:**  
- ‚ùå "Enhancement failed": Ensure task is clear and specific
- ‚ùå "Invalid format": Check outputFormat matches your data type

**Notification Issues:**
- ‚ùå "Webhook not receiving events": Verify HTTPS URL is accessible
- ‚ùå "Authentication errors": Check webhook signature validation

**API Issues:**
- ‚ùå "Authentication failed": Verify EXA_API_KEY is set correctly
- ‚ùå "Rate limiting": Space out requests, respect rate limits

**Best Practices:**
- Always check collection status before searching/enhancing
- Use descriptive resource IDs and tags for organization
- Monitor webhook endpoints for reliability
- Start with small collections to test workflows
        `
