# Progressive MCP Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the progressive MCP compliance implementation for the Exa Websets MCP Server.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1 (Complete)

1. **Fixed Default Transport Mode** ✅
   - Changed default from HTTP to STDIO (MCP standard)
   - Added clear logging to indicate which transport is being used
   - HTTP mode still available with `--http` flag

2. **Improved Error Handling** ✅
   - Created `src/utils/mcpErrors.ts` with MCP-compliant error utilities
   - Supports both new MCP error format and legacy format
   - Error format controlled by `MCP_FEATURE_ENHANCED_ERRORS` environment variable
   - Full backward compatibility maintained

3. **Added Basic Protocol Handlers** ✅
   - Implemented ping handler (always enabled)
   - Added stub handlers for logging and sampling
   - Handlers only registered when corresponding features are enabled

### Phase 2 (Prepared)

1. **Resource Module Structure** ✅
   - Created `src/resources/index.ts` with basic resource manager
   - Added TODO comments for future implementation
   - Module is wired up but functionality is stubbed

2. **Feature Flag System** ✅
   - Created `src/config/features.ts` with comprehensive feature management
   - All new features disabled by default
   - Features controlled via environment variables:
     - `MCP_FEATURE_RESOURCES`
     - `MCP_FEATURE_ENHANCED_ERRORS`
     - `MCP_FEATURE_PROGRESS_NOTIFICATIONS`
     - `MCP_FEATURE_LOGGING`
     - `MCP_FEATURE_SAMPLING`

## Key Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `/src/utils/mcpErrors.ts` - MCP error handling utilities
- `/src/config/features.ts` - Feature flag management
- `/src/resources/index.ts` - Resource module (stub)
- `/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for progressive adoption
- `/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `/src/index.ts` - Updated transport defaults, added protocol handlers

## How It Works

### Default Behavior
```bash
# Starts in STDIO mode (MCP standard)
npx exa-websets-mcp-server

# Use HTTP mode explicitly
npx exa-websets-mcp-server --http 3000
```

### Feature Enablement
```bash
# Enable enhanced errors
export MCP_FEATURE_ENHANCED_ERRORS=true

# Enable multiple features
export MCP_FEATURE_ENHANCED_ERRORS=true
export MCP_FEATURE_LOGGING=true
export MCP_FEATURE_SAMPLING=true
```

### Server Capabilities
- Capabilities are dynamically built based on enabled features
- Only advertises capabilities that are actually implemented
- Prevents protocol errors from unsupported features

## Testing

A test script (`test-progressive.js`) verifies:
1. Default STDIO mode works correctly
2. HTTP mode flag functions properly
3. Feature flags can be enabled/disabled

All tests pass successfully.

## Migration Path

1. **Immediate**: Users can update to this version with no changes
2. **Optional**: Enable features individually for testing
3. **Future**: Enable all desired features once validated

## Next Steps

To complete full MCP compliance:

1. **Implement Resource Support**
   - Complete resource listing and reading
   - Add websets guides and templates as resources
   - Enable resource subscriptions

2. **Implement Progress Notifications**
   - Add progress tracking for async operations
   - Send notifications for webset creation progress
   - Integrate with existing AsyncOperationManager

3. **Complete Logging Support**
   - Implement dynamic log level changes
   - Integrate with existing logger utility
   - Add structured logging output

4. **Add Sampling Support**
   - Implement completion/sampling handlers
   - Integrate with AI models for suggestions
   - Add context-aware completions

## Benefits

1. **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes for existing users
2. **Progressive Adoption**: Features can be enabled one at a time
3. **Future-Proof**: Infrastructure ready for full MCP compliance
4. **Stable**: Default configuration is proven and stable

## Conclusion

This progressive implementation provides a solid foundation for MCP compliance while maintaining stability and backward compatibility. Users can adopt new features at their own pace, and the server remains fully functional with or without the new capabilities.
