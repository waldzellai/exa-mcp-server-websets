## Remote Exa Websets MCP üåê

Connect directly to Exa's hosted MCP server (instead of running it locally).

### Remote MCP URL

```
https://mcp.exa.ai/websets?exaApiKey=your-exa-api-key
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

### Claude Desktop Configuration for Remote MCP

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa-websets": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.exa.ai/websets?exaApiKey=your-exa-api-key"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation üì¶

### NPM Installation

```bash
npm install -g exa-websets-mcp-server
```

### Using Smithery

To install the Exa Websets MCP server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/exa-websets):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install exa-websets --client claude
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### For Claude Desktop

#### 1. Configure Claude Desktop to recognize the Exa Websets MCP server

You can find claude_desktop_config.json inside the settings of Claude Desktop app:

Open the Claude Desktop app and enable Developer Mode from the top-left menu bar. 

Once enabled, open Settings (also from the top-left menu bar) and navigate to the Developer Option, where you'll find the Edit Config button. Clicking it will open the claude_desktop_config.json file, allowing you to make the necessary edits. 

OR (if you want to open claude_desktop_config.json from terminal)

##### For macOS:

```bash
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

##### For Windows:

```powershell
code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### 2. Add the Exa Websets server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa-websets": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-websets-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key from [dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys).

### For Claude Code

To configure this MCP server with Claude Code, use the following command:

```bash
# Install server locally first
npm install -g exa-websets-mcp-server

# Add to Claude Code with environment variable
claude mcp add exa-websets -e EXA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here -- npx exa-websets-mcp-server

# Or if you have built the project locally:
claude mcp add exa-websets -e EXA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here -- node /path/to/exa-websets-mcp-server/build/index.js
```

After adding the server, you can check its status with:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Use the `/mcp` command within Claude Code to verify the server is connected.

#### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

For the changes to take effect:

1. Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
2. Start Claude Desktop again
3. Look for the icon to verify the Exa Websets server is connected

## Using the Tools üõ†Ô∏è

### websets_manager

The unified websets manager provides a single interface for all websets operations:

```
# Create a new content collection
operation: create_collection
collection: { searchQuery: "AI news", description: "Latest AI developments" }

# Search within a collection
operation: search_collection
resourceId: "collection-id"
search: { query: "breakthrough", maxResults: 10 }

# Enhance content with AI
operation: enhance_content
resourceId: "collection-id"
enhancement: { task: "Extract key findings from each article" }
```

### web_search_exa

Perform real-time web searches:

```
query: "latest AI developments"
numResults: 10
```

### websets_guide

Get help and examples for using websets:

```
topic: "getting_started"
```

Available topics:
- getting_started
- creating_collections
- searching_content
- enhancing_data
- setting_notifications
- workflow_examples
- troubleshooting
- best_practices

## Using Prompts üí¨

Prompts provide interactive workflows that guide you through complex websets operations. They're especially useful for:
- Understanding the asynchronous nature of websets
- Learning best practices for different use cases
- Getting step-by-step instructions with example commands

To use a prompt in Claude, simply mention it:
- "Use the quick_start prompt to help me create my first webset"
- "Show me the webset_status_check for webset_abc123"

## Pagination and Polling Best Practices üìñ

### Automatic Pagination

The server automatically handles large responses to prevent token overflow:

```javascript
// List activities - automatically paginated if no limit specified
operation: "list_activities"
// Returns manageable chunks that fit within token limits

// Or specify your own limit if you know what you need
operation: "list_activities"
query: { limit: 5 }
```

**How it works:**
- If you don't specify a limit, the server automatically paginates results
- Starts with small batches and adjusts based on response size
- Prevents "response too large" errors from MCP clients
- Works for activities, websets, and content items

### Automatic Polling for Async Operations

Search and enhancement operations can now wait for results automatically:

```javascript
// Search with automatic polling (waits up to 1 minute)
operation: "search_webset"
resourceId: "webset_123"
search: {
  query: "AI startups",
  advanced: {
    waitForResults: true  // Enable auto-polling
  }
}

// Enhancement with automatic polling (waits up to 2 minutes)
operation: "enhance_content"
resourceId: "webset_123"
enhancement: {
  task: "Extract company names and funding",
  advanced: {
    waitForResults: true  // Enable auto-polling
  }
}
```

**Polling intervals:**
- Search: Checks every 2 seconds for up to 1 minute
- Enhancement: Checks every 3 seconds for up to 2 minutes
- No exponential backoff - predictable, reasonable intervals
- Progress updates logged during polling

**When to use:**
- Enable `waitForResults` when you need results immediately
- Disable it (default) when running batch operations
- Polling stops as soon as operation completes or fails
- "Guide me through enrichment_workflow for my completed webset"

Each prompt provides contextual guidance, example commands, and best practices tailored to your specific situation.

## Using via NPX

Run the server directly with npx:

```bash
# Run the websets server
npx exa-websets-mcp-server
```

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

1. **Server Not Found**
   * Verify the npm package is correctly installed
   * Check Claude Desktop configuration syntax (json file)

2. **API Key Issues**
   * Confirm your EXA_API_KEY is valid
   * Check the EXA_API_KEY is correctly set in the configuration
   * Verify no spaces or quotes around the API key

3. **Connection Issues**
   * Restart Claude Desktop completely
   * Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages

4. **Events API Unavailable**
   * The events endpoint may return 500 errors
   * Use webhooks for event notifications instead
   * Monitor webset status through get_collection_status
