# Webset Portal Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `webset_portal` prompt for deep-dive parallel research through webset URLs.

## Use Case: Analyzing AI Company Funding Rounds

Let's say you have a webset about "AI startups Series B funding 2024" and you want to understand the strategic implications of these funding rounds.

### Step 1: Create and Complete a Webset

First, create a webset with relevant results:

```javascript
// Create webset
const webset = await websets_search("AI startups Series B funding 2024", 200);
const websetId = webset.websetId;

// Wait for completion (or use webhooks)
// ... webset processing ...
```

### Step 2: Invoke the Webset Portal Prompt

In Claude Code, you would say:

```
Use the webset_portal prompt with:
- websetId: "ws_abc123"
- researchQuery: "What are the strategic implications of these funding rounds for the AI industry?"
- maxPortals: "5"
```

### Step 3: What Happens Next

The portal workflow will:

1. **Identify Top Portals** - Find the 5 most relevant URLs that best match your research query
   - Prioritizes URLs that were "full matches" for the original search
   - Scores based on title, content, and entity relevance

2. **Launch Parallel Subagents** - Claude Code creates 5 subagents, each assigned to one portal URL
   - Each subagent receives specific research instructions
   - They work simultaneously for faster results

3. **Deep Research** - Each subagent:
   - Visits their assigned portal URL
   - Follows relevant links (up to 2 levels deep)
   - Extracts key information related to your research query
   - Identifies quotes, data points, and facts
   - Assesses source credibility

4. **Synthesis** - The main agent combines all findings:
   - Groups insights by theme
   - Identifies patterns across sources
   - Flags contradictions
   - Generates recommendations

### Step 4: Example Output

Your final report will include:
