# Connection Issues Analysis: exa-mcp-server-websets

Based on the Smithery build logs (`SMITHERY_LOGS.md`), here are three hypotheses about why clients are unable to connect to the exa-mcp-server-websets server's tools:

## Hypothesis 1: Tool Discovery Timeout
**Root Cause**: MCP error -32001 (Request timed out) during tool scanning at line 59.

The build succeeded and deployment was successful, but Smithery failed to enumerate the available tools due to a timeout. This suggests the server is not responding to the `tools/list` request within the expected timeframe, likely because:
- The server is taking too long to initialize tools on startup
- Tool configurations are being loaded synchronously rather than lazily
- The server is blocking during heavy initialization operations (API key validation, service setup)

**Evidence**: "Failed to scan tools list from server: McpError: MCP error -32001: Request timed out"

## Hypothesis 2: Missing Lazy Loading Implementation
**Root Cause**: Server performs eager loading instead of lazy configuration loading.

Smithery's guidance at line 61 suggests implementing lazy loading of configurations. The current server architecture may be:
- Loading all tool configurations at startup
- Validating API connections during initialization
- Performing expensive operations before responding to tool discovery requests
- Not implementing the recommended lazy loading pattern for MCP servers

**Evidence**: "Please ensure your server performs lazy loading of configurations: https://smithery.ai/docs/build/deployments#tool-lists"

## Hypothesis 3: Transport Mode Mismatch
**Root Cause**: Server defaulting to incorrect transport protocol for Smithery deployment.

Based on the CLAUDE.md documentation, the server supports multiple transport modes:
- Default (no args): HTTP mode on port 3000
- `--stdio`: STDIO transport
- `--http [port]`: HTTP with custom port

Smithery may expect STDIO transport for tool discovery, but the server could be:
- Running in HTTP mode when STDIO is expected
- Binding to port 3000 which may be inaccessible in the container environment
- Not handling the specific transport protocol that Smithery uses for tool enumeration

**Evidence**: The build process doesn't show any transport configuration, and the timeout occurs specifically during tool scanning, not during the build/deployment phases.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Implement lazy loading** for tool configurations as suggested by Smithery
2. **Add startup logging** to identify which transport mode is being used
3. **Optimize tool initialization** to respond to discovery requests quickly
4. **Add timeout handling** for tool discovery operations
